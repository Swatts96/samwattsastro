**Countries of the World** is a dynamic web application built as my first semester final project for Logic and Programming. The project demonstrates fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by dynamically fetching data from a local JSON file and updating the UI in real time.

### What I Worked On

- **Dynamic Data Loading:**  
  Leveraged the Fetch API to retrieve country data from a local `countries.json` file and populate a dropdown menu with country names.

- **Flag Display and Name Normalization:**  
  Developed logic to display a countryâ€™s flag when selected. Special handling was added to normalize country names (e.g., replacing spaces with underscores) so that the correct flag image is loaded from the `flags/` folder.

- **Population and Area Calculations:**  
  Implemented functions to calculate and display population density, area (in square miles or square kilometers), and world population percentage for each country.

- **Interactive User Interface:**  
  Added event listeners on dropdowns, radio buttons, and buttons (e.g., a Wiki link) to dynamically update country details.

### Project Outcome

This project solidified my understanding of basic web programming techniques:
- **HTML & CSS:** Structured a clean, responsive layout enhanced with Bootstrap styling.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented interactive features and data manipulation techniques to present real-world data dynamically.
- **Error Handling:** Ensured that missing data or images are handled gracefully with fallbacks.
- **User Experience:** Created a visually engaging interface that displays country details in a clear and interactive manner.
