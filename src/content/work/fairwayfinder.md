For the **Fairway Finder** project, I built a modern, interactive application designed to help golf enthusiasts discover, navigate, and explore golf courses across Nova Scotia. This project combines straightforward HTML and JavaScript with the powerful Leaflet library for mapping, all fueled by data from a local `courses.json` file.

### What I Worked On

- **Interactive Mapping:**  
  Developed an intuitive interface that uses Leaflet to display course maps. Users can view course layouts and zoom in on specific areas for detailed information.

- **Dynamic Data Loading:**  
  Leveraged the Fetch API to load course data from a local JSON file, dynamically populating dropdowns and other UI elements. Special care was taken to handle country names with spaces by normalizing the names (e.g., replacing spaces with underscores) to match image file naming conventions.

- **Responsive and Engaging UI:**  
  Implemented a clean, responsive design using Bootstrap to ensure the app looks great on any device. Smooth animations and transitions enhance the user experience.

### Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts and Favourites:**  
  Allow users to register, save their favourite courses, and review courses they have played.
- **Live Course Mapping:**  
  Integrate live mapping data for real-time updates on course conditions.
