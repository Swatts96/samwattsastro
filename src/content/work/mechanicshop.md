The **Mechanic Shop Backend** project is a fullstack CRUD application built during the first half of my second year. This application enables authenticated users to manage a list of vehicles and maintenance records through an intuitive React-based interface. The project combines React/Vite for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

### What I Worked On

- **Frontend Development with React/Vite:**  
  Designed and built a dynamic user interface using React and Vite. The UI allows users to create, update, and delete mechanic shop entries seamlessly.

- **Backend API with Express.js:**  
  Implemented RESTful API endpoints to manage vehicle and maintenance data. These endpoints interact with a MongoDB database for persistent storage.

- **User Authentication:**  
  Integrated basic authentication to secure the application, ensuring that only authorized users can perform CRUD operations.

- **Responsive Design and Clean UI:**  
  Applied Bootstrap and custom CSS to create a clean, responsive layout that enhances user interaction and overall usability.

### Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Authentication and Roles:**  
  Introduce advanced user roles to control access, ensuring that only authorized personnel can update records.
- **Detailed Read Pages:**  
  Create detailed views for each vehicle entry that include comments and service history.
- **Commenting System:**  
  Allow users to add comments to document work performed on each car, including details like date completed and cost.
