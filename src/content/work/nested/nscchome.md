For our NSCC Home Page Redesign project, we re-envisioned the look and feel of the NSCC website to better reflect a modern digital presence while improving user experience and accessibility.

### What I Worked On

- **Responsive Layouts:**  
  We implemented a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Updated Branding and Visual Identity:**  
  Our redesign incorporated new color schemes, updated typography, and high-quality imagery to create a vibrant and engaging interface that aligns with NSCC's branding.

- **Enhanced Navigation:**  
  The new design features a more intuitive navigation system, including a prominent hero section and clearly defined sections that make it easy for users to find information.

### Project Outcome

The redesign not only modernized the NSCC home page but also provided a robust framework that can be easily updated in the future. The improved structure and user interface pave the way for enhanced content management and future scalability.

Overall, this project represents a successful blend of design and development, showcasing our ability to apply current web standards to create a visually appealing and functional website.
